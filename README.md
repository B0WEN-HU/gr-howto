# gr-howto

This is a reproduction of tutorial(https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php/OutOfTreeModules).

I created my first GNU Radio block, `square_ff`.

I created sync block `square_ff2` as tutorial does.

**The name of the module has been changed to `gr-mytutorial`, while the repository name stays as `gr-howto` for a while.**
